## Features

- **Blockchain Integration**: Uses Ethereum blockchain for storing votes and ensuring tamper-proof elections.
- **Security**: Implements cryptographic techniques to secure voting transactions.
- **Web3 Integration**: Interacts with the blockchain using Web3.js library.
- **User Interface**: Provides a user-friendly web interface for voters to securely cast their votes.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: Smart contract development on Ethereum blockchain.
- **Web3.js**: JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum nodes.
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for backend server (optional).

## Setup Instructions

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/secure-ballot.git
   cd secure-ballot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Web3 connection**:
   - Update `web3.js` file in `src/web3/` with your blockchain node URL and contract ABI/address.

4. **Start the frontend application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.

5. **Deploy smart contract**:
   - Deploy the `Voting.sol` smart contract on your preferred Ethereum network (e.g., Ganache, Ropsten, Mainnet).

## Usage

- Access the web application at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port specified by `npm start`).
- Users can register, vote for candidates, and view election results securely.
- Ensure that your Ethereum node (e.g., Ganache) is running and connected to the application.
